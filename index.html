            <p>This birthday is important to me since I will become an adult man and I have discovered many things
                including creating web-sites, playing musical instruments, making games, programming in C# (C-sharp), Python, Basic and many interesting hobbies.
                I wish I could finally get the bass guitar (GSR200 BLK) which is shown in the picture <img src="img/bass.jpg">, because it is very 
                nice and tough instrument, learn Javascript, get more merchendize 
                (Like more Burzum or Cannibal Corpse clothes). I want to thank all people I know like my friends, relatives who were
                supporting me until now.
